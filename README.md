# Zonally Averaged Atmospheric Model (ZAAM)

The goal of this project is to find a minimal 1-D atmospheric model that
can simulate a reasonable three-cells Earth. Long-term goal of this model is
to couple to a hierarchy of ocean model to explore long-term climatological 
phenomenon. In particular, I want to close the problem of ITCZ shift with 
simple model, given much of the coupled GCM simulations have suggested it does
not involve wave activity. This suggests that it is possible to find a
1-D model to capture the ITCZ shift problem.
